# Jager_JohnLemon Modification for IU instructor Ian Sundstrom's MSCH-G300

Modifications
1. Top-down camera position
2. Shooting mechanic aimed with the mouse
    ghosts die when hit with a bullet
3. Ghosts follow player once spotted and break off of waypoint patrol
    ghosts can walk through objects (because they're ghosts) when nothing else can
4. Modified game end conditions
    Player loses if ghost collides with player
    Player wins if all ghosts are killed
    Player receives a silver medal at the end screen for a round that takes more than 65 seconds, and a gold for less than that
5. Modified game feel
    Ghosts and player are faster
    Movements are fairly snappy, but with leeway on the ghost movement (they overshoot)
6. Level
    A large warehouse with shipping containers serving as barriers
    Wood boxes and barrels serve as envrionmental props
7. Post-processing
    Post processing is fairly warm and bright
